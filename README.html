<p>This is a Wordpress Theme I&#8217;m working on built on to of <code>_s</code>, or <code>underscores</code>, if you like. </p>

<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar, <code>_s</code> is a theme meant for hacking, with the state goal of &#8220; &#8221;try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there&quot;. </p>

<p>I SASSified my <code>_s</code> because &#8230; well because it&#8217;s better and I wanted to finally learn how to work with SASS. </p>

<h2 id="projectdescription">Project Description</h2>

<p>I started this project as a portfolio theme for my fiance&#8217;s photography. Luckily enough, she didn&#8217;t give me much direction or a deadline, so I took it as an opportunity to play around with some new technology and workflows.</p>

<p>You can check out my fiance&#8217;s site to get an idea of what the theme looks like in action.</p>

<h2 id="howimworking.">How I&#8217;m working.</h2>

<h2 id="vagrant">Vagrant</h2>

<p>One of the things I struggle with the most when getting started on a new development project is figuring out my workflow. I&#8217;ve been trying to simplify it and optimize it for a while. Both for wordpress development and development in general.</p>

<p>While working on wealthbot.io, I learned from our technical lead about <a href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> and man is it awesome. Trying to get wealthbot.io to run on OSX using the traditional approach: a combination of MAMP, plus MongoDB and making sure my PHP was up to date and my hosts file was setup correctly, etc, etc was a nightmare.</p>

<p>Once I downloaded Vagrant and Virtual Box though, it was a breeze. <code>vagrant up</code> and we&#8217;re off to the races.</p>

<p>I was eternally unhappy with my Wordpress environment, so I began to wonder if there was a Vagrant solution. Lo and behold, VVV.</p>

<p>As long as you have enough space, and have Vargrant + Virtual Box installed, you can download VVV, run <code>vagrant up</code> and a brand new wordpress environment is running on a virtual server inside your machine!</p>

<h2 id="codekit">Codekit</h2>

<p>As I mentioned, I&#8217;m using a SASS version of <code>_s</code> for this project, which means I need a way of &#8220;watching&#8221; and compiling in CSS. </p>

<p>Not everything was easy-breezy thought, I had a hell of a time trying to get ?Grunt? to work with VVV. Eventually I decided that was going to be a challenge for another project. Codekit to the rescue. Pop my theme folder inCodekit, take a guess at a few settings and BAM, automatic SASS AND automatic browser reloading! On multiple devices! </p>

<h2 id="moreabouthowthisthemewasbuilt">More About How This Theme Was Built</h2>

<p>OK, so I&#8217;ve pushed, prodded and hacked away at this theme and I&#8217;m really digging how Vicky&#8217;s site came out. It&#8217;s simple, picture forward and (in my opinion) has just the right touch of animation to make for an interesting presentation. </p>

<p>About halfway through working on this project, I got the idea to share the theme, help others setup clean, simple Wordpress portfolio sites. And at the same time, hopefully, get some help cleaning up my SASS. </p>

<p>This area is where I think the theme needs the most help. I did what I could, but I feel like I didn&#8217;t take full advantage of the syntax, variables and other awesome Sassy features.</p>

<p>Still, it&#8217;s possible and should be pretty easy, to customize this theme for your own portfolio. The structure section will explain how the theme works, so you know how to hack it.</p>

<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>

<p>Let&#8217;s start from the top. First things first, I updated the variables in <code>sass/variables-site/</code> to use the colors and fonts that I thought would appeal to Vicky. </p>

<p>I ended up playing with these quite a bit and end up using mainly whites and grays based on the advice of this post. Then I added a splash of color with <code>$color__background-body: #99CCCC;</code> figuring between that and the color rich photography, there was no need to get fancy. </p>

<p>Next I started hacking away at header.php and style.scss to head the header looking the way I wanted to. </p>

<h2 id="gettingyourownstartertheme">Getting your own starter theme</h2>

<p>If you want to keep it simple, head over to http://underscores.me and generate your <code>_s</code> based theme from there. You just input the name of the theme you want to create, click the &#8220;Generate&#8221; button, and you get your ready-to-awesomize starter theme.</p>
