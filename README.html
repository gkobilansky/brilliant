<p>This is a Wordpress Theme I&#8217;m working on built on to of <code>_s</code>, or <a href="http://underscores.me/"><code>underscores</code></a>, if you like. </p>

<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar, <code>_s</code> is a theme meant for hacking, with the state goal of &#8220; &#8221;try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there&quot;. </p>

<p>I SASSified my <code>_s</code> because &#8230; well because it&#8217;s better and I wanted to finally learn how to work with SASS.</p>

<h2 id="projectdescription">Project Description</h2>

<p>I started this project as a portfolio theme for my fiancée&#8217;s photography. Luckily enough, she didn&#8217;t give me much direction or a deadline, so I took it as an opportunity to play around with some new technology and workflows.</p>

<p>You can check out my fiancée&#8217;s site <a href="http://vickybrigis.com">Vicky Brigis Photography</a> to get an idea of what the theme looks like in action.</p>

<h2 id="howimworking.">How I&#8217;m working.</h2>

<h3 id="vagrant">Vagrant</h3>

<p>One of the things I struggle with the most when getting started on a new development project is figuring out my workflow. I&#8217;ve been trying to simplify it and optimize it for a while. Both for wordpress development and development in general.</p>

<p>While working on <a href="https://github.com/wealthbot-io/wealthbot">wealthbot.io</a>, I learned from <a href="https://github.com/vlad-ko">our technical lead</a> about <a href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> and man is it awesome. Trying to get wealthbot.io to run on OSX using the traditional approach: a combination of MAMP, plus MongoDB and making sure my PHP was up to date and my hosts file was setup correctly, etc, etc &#8230; was a nightmare.</p>

<p>Once I downloaded Vagrant and Virtual Box though, it was a breeze. <code>vagrant up</code> and we&#8217;re off to the races.</p>

<h3 id="backtowordpress">Back to Wordpress</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve been eternally unhappy with my Wordpress environment, so I began to wonder if there was a Vagrant solution. Lo and behold, <a href="https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV">VVV</a>.</p>

<p>As long as you have enough space, and have Vargrant + Virtual Box installed, you can download VVV, run <code>vagrant up</code> and a brand new wordpress environment is running on a virtual server inside your machine!</p>

<h3 id="codekit">Codekit</h3>

<p>As I mentioned, I&#8217;m using a SASS version of <code>_s</code> for this project, which means I need a way of &#8220;watching&#8221; and compiling my SASS to CSS. </p>

<p>Not everything was easy-breezy thought, I had a hell of a time trying to get <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">gulp</a> to work. Eventually I decided that was going to be a challenge for another project. <a href="https://incident57.com/codekit/">Codekit</a> to the rescue. Drag my theme folder into Codekit and BAM, automatic SASS AND automatic browser reloading! On multiple devices! </p>

<h2 id="howthisthemewasbuilt">How This Theme Was Built</h2>

<p>OK, so I&#8217;ve pushed, prodded and hacked away at this theme and I&#8217;m really digging how Vicky&#8217;s site came out. It&#8217;s simple, picture forward and (in my opinion) has just the right touch of animation to make for an interesting presentation. </p>

<p>About halfway through working on this project, I got the idea to share the theme to help others setup clean, simple Wordpress portfolio sites. And at the same time, hopefully, get some help cleaning up my SASS. </p>

<p>This area is where I think the theme needs the most help. I did what I could, but I feel like I didn&#8217;t take full advantage of the syntax, variables and other awesome Sassy features.</p>

<p>Still, it&#8217;s possible and should be pretty easy, to customize this theme for your own portfolio. The structure section will explain how the theme works, so you know how to hack it.</p>

<h2 id="howitworks">How it works</h2>

<p>The structure of the site goes something like this:</p>

<p><strong>Header and menu</strong></p>

<figcaption>menu</figcaption>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>

<p><strong>Featured Image &amp; Title</strong></p>

</figure>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>

<p><strong>Post &amp; Gallery</strong></p>

<figure>
<img src="/pics-for-readme/post-and-gallery.png" alt="post" />
<figcaption>post</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The home page is an index of all blog posts. The menu is custom made and I set it to anchor link to the post title.</p>

<p>The images on the home page are the featured images for each new blog post you create.</p>

<p>Each image links to a post, where we use <a href="http://jetpack.me/support/tiled-galleries/">Jetpack Tiled Galleries</a> to create a clean looking, interactive gallery. </p>

<p>This means you can have as many new &#8220;categories&#8221; on the home page as blog posts. Which could get pretty unwieldy if you&#8217;re writing a lot of new posts. </p>

<p>That&#8217;s now how I envision this theme being used. The idea for is less about content and more about making it easy to setup a few portfolio categories.</p>

<h2 id="howitsbuilt">How its built</h2>

<p>Let&#8217;s start from the top. </p>

<h3 id="variables">Variables</h3>

<p>First things first, I updated the variables in <code>sass/variables-site/</code> to use the colors and fonts that I thought would appeal to Vicky. </p>

<p>I played with these quite a bit at first, but end up using mainly whites and grays based on the advice of <a href="https://medium.com/@erikdkennedy/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-1-559d4e805cda">this post</a>. Then I added a splash of color with <code>$color__background-body: #99CCCC;</code> figuring between that and the color rich photography, there was no need to get fancy. </p>

<h3 id="headerandfooter">Header and Footer</h3>

<p>Next, I started hacking away at header.php and style.scss to get the header looking the way I wanted to.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t like the way the custom_header functionality was implemented, plus I only wanted to use the header image on the home page, so I added </p>

<p><code>&lt;?php if (is_front_page()) echo &quot;home-background&quot;;?&gt;</code></p>

<p>to the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> class and styled <code>.home-background</code> in style.scss. Was this the right way to do things? No idea, but it works for me.</p>

<p>Similar approach with footer.php, but I use the same footer across the whole site, so no need to get as fancy. </p>

<p>By the way, header, footer, background and logo images (there&#8217;s right, I have 2 logos) are in brilliant/inc and titled: </p>

<ul>
<li>headerbg.png</li>
<li>footerbg.png</li>
<li>bg.png</li>
<li>logo.png and minilogo.png</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="layout">Layout</h3>

<p>I don&#8217;t like <a href="http://blog.videofruit.com/website-sidebar/">sidebars</a>, both from a design perspective and from a conversion perspective. Not that this theme is built for conversions or anything.</p>

<p>So, I created brilliant/sass/layout/_content-nosidebar.scss to get <em>really</em> content focused.</p>

<h3 id="homemenu">Home Menu</h3>

<p>The idea here again, was to give it a little bit of style, animation and keep it clean.</p>

<p>At first I styled the menu in style.scss, but decided to move everything to sass/navigation/_menus.scss. </p>

<h3 id="homepagescrolling">Home Page Scrolling</h3>

<p>This theme is using the home menu to scroll down the page, not to navigate to other pages. So I created js/brilliant.js and added <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/">this code from CSS Tricks</a>.</p>

<h3 id="featuredimages">Featured Images</h3>

<p>I copied index.php into home.php, but updated it to display both the featured image (<code>&lt;?php the_post_thumbnail(); ?&gt;</code>) and title of each post. Because I set <code>.content-area {width:100%;}</code>, the images cover my full browser but are larger than my screen&#8217;s full height.</p>

<p>Using
```
.featured{
 img {
 display: block;
 transition: all .5s ease-in-out 500ms;
 }</p>

<pre><code>img:hover {
    transform: scale(.69);
    margin: auto;
    }   
</code></pre>

<p>}<br/>
```
made for a simple animation that made me happy and let me see the full photograph.</p>

<p>I added a post permalink to the featured images and decided to use the included Jetpack Tiled Galleries for my portfolio galleries. </p>

<h3 id="jetpacktiledgalleries">Jetpack Tiled Galleries</h3>

<p>In this way, each post is a new portfolio category and I use a the galleries to present the actual photos.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With Tiled Galleries you can display your image galleries in three new styles: a rectangular mosaic, a square mosaic, and a circular grid. The rectangular and square tiled layouts also have hover-over captions to save space while making captions accessible.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="gettingyourownstartertheme">Getting your own starter theme</h2>

<p>If you want to keep it simple, head over to http://underscores.me and generate your <code>_s</code> based theme from there. You just input the name of the theme you want to create, click the &#8220;Generate&#8221; button, and you get your ready-to-awesomize starter theme.</p>
